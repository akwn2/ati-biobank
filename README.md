# ATI Biobank Project


Repository for the code and notes for the ATI Biobank project.

There should be **absolutely no data** on this repository to comply with the UK Biobank Data Usage Terms.

## Main files to look at

* ```notes.tex```: group notes on things to do, questions and other resources
* ```data-description.tex```: data description, explanation and other hints
* Other ```.tex``` files are useful for specific information


We do not keep copies of compiled versions of the .tex file, you need to compile it locally.



## Dependencies


* LaTeX (preferrably ```tex-live```, like ```mac-tex```).
* Matlab (use remotely)


We'll update this as the project moves along. We'll probably include R or something like that.
