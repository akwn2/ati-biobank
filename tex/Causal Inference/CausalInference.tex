\section{Causal Inference methods}
Major methods to look at: Bayesian net, LinGAM
\section{R packages for causal iferenc eand Bayesian network}
The CRAN task view for graphical Models (see \href{https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/gR.html}) lists most popular packages for causal inference and Bayesian network and the relevant ones are listed below:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \url{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gRapHD/index.html}{gRapHD}: Efficient selection of undirected graphical models for high-dimensional datasets
\item \url{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/parcor/index.html}{parcor}: estimation of partial correlation.
\item \url{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pcalg/index.html}{pcalg}: Methods for graphical models and causal inference, including the PC algorithm 
\item \url{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/abn/index.html}{abn}: Modelling Multivariate Data with Additive Bayesian Networks
\item \url{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bnlearn/index.html}{bnlearn}: Bayesian Network Structure Learning, Parameter Learning and Inference
\item \url{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/deal/index.html}{deal}: Learning Bayesian Networks with Mixed Variables

\end{enumerate}
\section{Python}

\section{Others}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \url{http://www.phil.cmu.edu/projects/tetrad/}{TETAD}: Tetrad is limited to models of categorical data (which can also be used for ordinal data) and to linear models ("structural equation models') with a Normal probability distribution, and to a very limited class of time series models.
